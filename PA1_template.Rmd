This is an R Markdown document for the first Peer Assignment.

First load the activity data into a data frame and have a glimpse into the data with the help of summary functon. 

```{r}
act_data <- read.csv("./data/activity.csv")
summary(act_data)
```

Since there are missing values I will replace those with the mean values for that particular interval range and recreate the dataset.

```{r}
library(plyr)
int_mean <- function(x) replace(x, is.na(x), mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
new_act_data <-  plyr::ddply(act_data[1:3], .(interval),transform, steps = int_mean(steps),date = date,interval=interval) 
```

Now get the count of steps for each day
```{r}
countSteps <- aggregate(steps ~ date, new_act_data, sum)
```

Generate the histogram of the number of steps per day.
```{r}
hist(countSteps$steps, main = "Total number of steps per day", xlab="Number of steps")
```
